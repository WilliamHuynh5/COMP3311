# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q12

(a) No.
consider the conflict operations.
Firstly R(Y) is before W(Y) which means T2 -> T1.
Secondly, for the write operations on X, T1 must happen before T2 and T2 must happen before T3,
hence T1->T2->T3. 
Now, we can see that edges in the precedence graph T1->T2 and T2->T1 form a cycle, 
hence by definition the schedule is not conflict serializable.  

(b)
Yes.
consider the following serial schedule T2 -> T1 -> T3.

T2: R(Y) W(X)
T1:          W(Y) W(X)
T3:                    W(X)

and the origional schedule.
T1:           W(Y)     W(X)

T2:  R(Y)                       W(X)

T3:                                      W(X)

Note that for these scheduals T2 is doing the initial read of Y and T1 is doing
the final write on Y, T3 is doing the final write on X.
Since there's simply no read operations on X and no read operations after a write operations on Y.
By definition all the 3 conditions of view serializability is satisfied.
Hence, the origional schedule is view equivalent to the serial schedule T2, T1, T3.
