# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q10

(a)
for the Flights relation
fid -> from
fid -> to
fid -> distance
fid -> departs
fid -> arrives
fid -> price
from to -> distance

for the Aircraft relation
aid -> aname
aid ->  range

for the Employees relation
eid -> ename
eid -> salary


(b)
from to -> distance violates BCNF since (from, to) is not a super key of relation Flights and this fd is non-trival
hence we must decompose the table into
Route(from, to, distance) key = (from, to) fds = {from, to -> distance}
Flights(fid, from, to, departs, arrives, price) key = fid, fds = {fid -> from, to, departs, arrives, price}
Aircraft(aid, aname, range) key = aid, fds = {aid -> aname, range}
Certified(employee, aircraft) key = (employee, aircraft) fds = {}
Employees(eid, ename, salary) key = (eid) fds = {eid -> ename, salary}
